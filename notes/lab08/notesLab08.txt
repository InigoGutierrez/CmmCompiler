Implement the identification pass of the semantic analysis phase.
Complete SymbolTable.java to make SymbolTableTest.java succeed.
Then, implement the identification pass.
Check the correct implementation showing input.txt with the introspector.
The 4 error messages in input-wrong.txt must be prompted by the compiler.

Identification phase

Error 1: Variable already defined (in the same scope always)
Error 2: Variable not defined (same for not defined functions)

Field: Definition definition in Variable

Methods of symbol table: insert, find to deal with symbols; set, reset to deal with scopes

The symbol table is a private attribute of the visitor.

When created, the symbol table is implicitly in the global scope.

When function definition is found: insert and set, then traverse child nodes (like FunctionType),
Visitor handles traversing child nodes.

Activity 1: Implement Symbol Table

find returns null if nothing found

Activity 2: Implement IdentificationVisitor

Check that scope field has correct value
